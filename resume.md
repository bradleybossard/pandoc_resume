Experience
----------

**Senior Software Engineer - [VenueNext](http://www.venuenext.com/) - *2016 - Present* **

VenueNext is a venture funded startup that is building a platform for
mobile apps and integrating all the various services of venue (ticketing,
food & beverage ordering, loyalty, etc) in a single experience.  As a
senior engineer on this remote team, my duties include

* Mobile development on both iOS and Android.

* Driving platform development, including API specification, UI design
  of platform features, and cross-platform feature implementation.


**Frontend Developer - [Aniden Interactive](http://www.aniden.com/) - *2012-2016* **

At Aniden, I was involved in developing interactive projects for clients like HP, Yahoo and Exxon, using a diverse mix of technologies. A small sampling of projects would include the following:

* [Yahoo Doodle](http://aniden.com/project/yahoo_logo) - Created pipeline to optimize and sprite an image sequence and custom Javascript to run on the Yahoo homepage to handle loading and animating the sprite.

* [Race For The Stars](http://aniden.com/project/race_for_the_stars) - Virtual reality game built using Unity 3D for the client and MEAN/Angular stack on the backend scoreboard.  Let's uses race through an HP datacenter in a Temple Run-like game and race for the best times/scores.

* [Finish Drawing](http://finishdrawing.com) - Web app game entered for [Wacom Inkation](http://devpost.com/software/finishdrawing-com) contest, and won 3rd place.  Game pairs an adjective/noun combo and asks the user to finish the drawing in 10 seconds given a random line, then adds it to a gallery.  Built using MEAN JS and Wacom WILL API.

* [Touch table](http://vimeo.com/105898051#t=13) - large tabletop interactive timeline for Baker Hughes Employee Education Center.  Multi-user experience allows users to touch the screen to animate a spline and explore events in the companies history.  Built using Google Chrome App framework and HTML canvas.

* [HP Discover Mobility Experience](http://aniden.com/project/mobility_touch_experience) - Trade show installation written using Chrome App framework.  Deployed on large screen touch and tablets, and featured a unique approach to navigate through the animations by segementing the videos into transitions rendering both forward and backward, then loading and playing the proper segment during the navigation.

* *MPM* - Project management app for visualizing project milestones over hundreds of project simutaneousl in a corporate setting.  PHP/MySQL backend, jQuery and assorted frameworks on the frontend.

* PhoneGap-based iOS app for navigating and viewing a curated set of corporate training videos

* Multiple 120" touchwall kiosk projects, some using Flash, others implemented using Chrome Packaged apps using HTML5 canvas for rendering.

* [Cliphoarder](http://cliphoarder.com/) - Win8 app and unreleashed Android app for copying assets from clipboard into local/SkyDrive/Dropbox stores.  Win8 implementation used WinJS apis for development, Android used Native Android.  Both made use of Skydrive and Dropbox APIs for authentication and storage. 

* Native Android apps for HP devces for retail kiosk applications.
    * [HP 7 VoiceTab](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aniden.hp7voicetab.app)
    * [HP 7 Slate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aniden.android.pine)
    * [HP Slatebook X2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aniden.android.hp.screensaver.slatebook)
    * [HP Slate 21](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aniden.android.hp.screensaver.aio)


**Software Engineer - [Google](http://www.google.com/) - *2007-2012* **

While at Google, I have namely worked in geo-related (digital mapping) technologies, and have been involved in...

- Writing a C++ pipeline for the automated creation of 3D buildings in Google Earth.

- Writing a C++ pipeline/server for serving tiled, hierarchical aerial imagery, initially used for the Google Building Maker product (now defunct).

- Writing a GAE / Python server for QA'ing 3D content.  This technology was solely implemented by myself and allowed multiple operators to score individual three models using Google Earth.

- Writing Javascript/Flash code for Google Street View and Google Maps.  Particular tasks included refactoring the Street View embed codebase, and rewriting the rendering code for displaying full 3D overlays for driving directions in the Street View Flash viewer.

- 20% project to create a 3D modeling and sprite generation pipeline for creating "speciality Pegman" for Streetview.  Over the courses of two years, I created roughly 20 special Pegman used to celebrate certain holidays or special Street View imagery collection launches.  A few of them are available below.  The project also required Google Maps server modifications (done by me) so we could control the location and time the special Pegman were available to the users.

- Writing interactive Doodles for the Google homepage.  In addition to authoring interactive doodles, 
I implemented the initial version of the Doodle Gallery at www.google.com/doodles

Particular Doodles I authored include the following links below

**Systems Engineer - Urban Scan - *2005 - 2007* **

Urban Scan was a small start-up focused on developing automated 3D modeling techniques for urban environments. During my two years, I was responsible for the following...

* Writing C++ code for a real-time acquisition system composed of high speed digital cameras, GPS, and laser scanners.
* Design and manufacture of the collection platform including soldering custom cabling/PCBs, and designing a custom power supply used by all onboard sensors.
* Evaluation, research and purchasing of all hardware used by the company.
* Point of contact for DARPA project integrators, including daily phone calls, bi-monthly travel to Washington D.C. and several on-site integration trips.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
