**Senior Software Engineer - [VenueNext] - *2016 - Present* **

VenueNext is a venture-funded startup building a platform for
mobile and integrating all the services of a venue (ticketing,
food & beverage ordering, loyalty, etc) in a single user experience.  As a
senior engineer on this remote team, my duties include

* Mobile development on both iOS and Android.

* Driving platform development, including API specification, UI design
  of platform features, and cross-platform feature implementation.

**Frontend Developer - [Aniden Interactive] - *2012-2016* **

At Aniden, I was involved in developing interactive projects for clients like HP, Yahoo and Exxon, using a diverse mix of technologies. A small sampling of projects would include the following:

* [Yahoo Doodle] - Created Python pipeline to optimize and sprite an image sequence and custom Javascript for the Yahoo homepage to handle loading and animating the sprite.

* [Race For The Stars] - Virtual reality game built using Unity 3D for the client and MEAN JS stack on the backend scoreboard.  App allows users to race through an HP datacenter in a Temple Run-like game and compete for the best times/scores.

* [Finish Drawing] - Web app game entered for [Wacom Inkation] contest, winning 3rd place.  Game pairs an adjective/noun combo and asks the user to finish the drawing in 10 seconds given a random line, then adds it to a gallery.  Built using MEAN JS and Wacom WILL API.

* [Touch table] - Large interactive tabletop timeline for Baker Hughes Employee Education Center.  Multi-user experience allows users to touch the screen to animate a spline and explore events in the companies history.  Built using Chrome App framework and HTML canvas.

* [HP Discover Mobility Experience] - Trade show piece that allows users to navigate forward/backwards through a series of animations.  Written as a JS Chrome App, deployed on touch wall and tablets.

* [Cliphoarder] - WinJS app and unreleashed Android app for copying assets from clipboard into local/SkyDrive/Dropbox stores.  Development used WinJS, Android SDK, and Dropbox/Skydrive APIs.

* **Android Kiosk Apps** - Native Android apps for HP devices for retail applications.
    * [HP 7 VoiceTab]
    * [HP 7 Slate]
    * [HP Slatebook X2]
